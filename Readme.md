# Leaf.js

Leaf.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for building reactive UI components directly in HTML using data attributes. It enables dynamic behavior through a simple scope-based architecture — no build tools, no bundler, no complex setup required.

**✨ Key Features**
- Scope-based component system
- DOM targeting via `data-target`
- Declarative event binding via `data-action`
- Reactive values through `data-*` attributes
- Lifecycle hooks (`connect` & `disconnect`)
- Auto DOM observation via `MutationObserver`
- Zero dependencies, extremely lightweight
